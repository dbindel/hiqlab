Install instructions:

1. Edit make.inc to point to gcc, g++, and dlltool (these may be ordinary
   compilers or cross-compilers -- see note below).

2. Set MEXMINGW32 in make.inc to the root directory where the mex
   build system will be installed.

3. Either copy the Windows MATLAB/extern/include subdirectory to
   mexinc, or point the WMEXINC variable in make.inc to your Windows 
   MATLAB/extern/include directory.

4. Type "make install" to build the support libraries.

5. Type "make" to build the test file (eventq2mex).  The test driver is
   testq2.m.


Setting up new MEX files:

For very simple MEX files (like the event queue example), you can use
the pattern rules defined in mex.inc.  For more complicated MEX files,
you will want to define rules something like this:

mymex.dll:
        $(CC) -c $(WMEXCFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) mymex.c
        $(CC) -shared $(WMEXLIBDIR)/mex.def -o mymex.dll -s 
                mymex.o mylib.a $(WMEXLIBS)

where mymex.c and mylib.a are things that you have defined, and the
various macros are provided in make.inc.

If you are compiling C++ MEX files, you will need to use g++ rather
than gcc to compile the final DLL.


NOTE: 

If you want to build a cross-compiler system for producing target MEX
files on mingw32, you will first want to set up a cross-compiler.  I used
the instructions from:
