I am pleased to announce the release of MWrap, a tool in the spirit of
SWIG for generating MATLAB and Octave interfaces to C/C++ code.  MWrap
input files consist of ordinary MATLAB code augmented with lines that
describe C/C++ function and method calls.  From these, MWrap produces
a MEX file to handle the calls and MATLAB scripts to call the MEX
file.  The source and manual are available at
