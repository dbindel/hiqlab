(http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~dbindel/matexpr/)

matexpr is a source-to-source translator for embedding simple MATLAB-like
matrix expressions in C/C++.  matexpr interprets special comments in a source
file and uses them to generate ordinary C code.

To compile, edit make.inc and then run make.  The output will be a standalone
executable (matexpr) in the main directory.

The user's guide (matexpr.pdf) describes matexpr in more detail; you can also
look at the example subdirectory to get some idea of how matexpr is used.
