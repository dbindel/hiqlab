\section{Evaluating fields}

There are a variety of functions that we might want to evaluate
inside elements: stress, heat flux, power flux, potential gradient,
etc.  We might also want some interesting combination of these
variables.  The {\tt FieldEval} interface provides a uniform way
of calling these functions, so we can (for example) write a generic
loop to evaluate a function $f(X)$ at all the Gauss points in the
mesh and then compute an $L^2$ projection.

At present, the only implementation of this interface is
{\tt FieldEvalPower}, which makes a call back to the element
{\tt mean\_power} method.
\begin{verbatim}

class FieldEval {
 public:
    virtual ~FieldEval();
    virtual void operator()(Mesh* mesh, int eltid, double* X, double* fX) = 0;
};

class FieldEvalPower : public FieldEval {
 public:
    ~FieldEvalPower();
    void operator()(Mesh* mesh, int eltid, double* X, double* fX);
};

\end{verbatim}
