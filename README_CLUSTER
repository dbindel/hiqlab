1. Configure:
   In the directory HIQLAB_HOME, open file 

     config_cluster

   and modify the directories for the,

     BLAS and LAPACK

   as well as the MPI compilers for c, c++, and fortran.
   Then run the script file.

   > ./config_cluster
   
2. Construct HIQLAB:
   In the directory HIQLAB_HOME

   > make hybrid

6. Run tests:
   Set one environment variable,

   export HIQ_INIT = HIQLAB_HOME/init.lua

   The tests are located in the directory HIQLAB_HOME/test_cluster.
   Modify the Makefile so that the number of processes

     NP

   and the mpirun command

     MPIRUN

   are correct. Then run the tests,

   > make test_petsc
   > make test_trilinos

   The results are saved in files

     petsc_results_X.txt
     trilinos_results_X.txt

   respectively, where the X is replaced by the number of processes running.

7. Intrepretation of results:
   All compuations are solving linear systems of equations iteratively 
   for the solution vector x

       A x = b

   where A is a given matrix and b is a given vector. A preconditioner P can
   be applied to make it easier to solve this problem.

       PA x = Pb

   The accuracy of the solution can be measured in several ways.

     Preconditioned          residual:  resid_prec     = ||PA x - Pb||
     Preconditioned Relative residual:  resid_prec_rel = ||PA x - Pb|| / ||Pb||
     Absolute                residual:  resid_abs      = || A x -  b||
     Relative                residual:  resid_rel      = || A x -  b|| / ||b||

   where ||b|| is the norm of the vector b. The tolerance for convergence
   is set in the code as the following,

     Petsc: Computation is stopped when,

                       resid_prec_rel < 1.0e-9  ---    CONVERGENCE
                       iterations     > 1000    --- NO CONVERGENCE

     Trilinos: Computation is stopped when,

                       resid_rel      < 1.0e-9  ---    CONVERGENCE
                       iterations     > 1000    --- NO CONVERGENCE

   YYYY_results_X.txt

      -NDOF                    : Degrees of freedom of the problem
                                 (approx. size of matrix)
      -Norm of residual(prec)  : 2-Norm of the preconditioned residual
      -Norm of residual(abs)   : 2-Norm of the absolute residual
      -Norm of residual(rel)   : 2-Norm of the relative residual
      -Number of Iterations    : Number of iterations conducted in method
      -Elapsed time            : Total time to execute code        (seconds)
      -Elapsed time(Only solve): Time spent to compute x from Ax=b (seconds)

   The solutions are not accurate unless the relative residual is 
   small(around 1e-6).
