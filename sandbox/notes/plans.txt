Paper plans:

IJNME paper:
 - Thermoelastic damping
 - Resolution of the imaginary part of the eigenvalue
 - Interpretation of the PML elements via coordinate transformation
 - Exploiting the low rank structure of Im(A)
 - Srikar and Senturia example
 - Convergence study

JMEMS:
 - Synopsis of PML + co
 - Michigan disk resonators
 - Model reduction
 - Study of mode-mixing

JMEMS: 
 - Synopsis of PML + co (ref to tech report)
 - Lame mode resonator
 - SiGe BLR
 - Michigan disk resonators

Examples:
  BLR
  Mich disk (Si and Si-diamond)
  Beam example from Srikar and Senturia
  Coupled Lame-mode resonators
  Ping Brian Bircumshaw regarding RBAR example?

Cycle -- finish examples, write paper, and revise examples.

Convergence analysis is basically done.  Try putting in a wave reflector
or something like that to illustrate that we're getting reasonable results
and that we can predict something useful.  Still waiting on material
parameters.
