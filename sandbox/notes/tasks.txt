- Visualization in 3D case?

- Set up BLR example
  - Build mesh
  - Try Matlab until it croaks...

- Finish moving code to C, parallelize if needed
  - Mesh tie code
  - UMFPACK call
  - ARPACK call
  - Visualization?

- Perturbation analysis
  - For computing the imaginary part of the eigenvalue?
  - For variations in the Q value with respect to geometry changes?
  - For trying to determine needed resolution a priori?
    (and deciding why it seems to need to be so high?)

- Question from Ushinish: analysis in axisymmetric case?

- Thermoelastic + PML combination
